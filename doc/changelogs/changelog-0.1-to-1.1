. the checktargets php script now gives status updates while running; it also takes a
  -v option for verbose output

  --pending-only option to only check nodes which have pending events
. added a new php script: checknode, to check the status of a single node on all target feeds
. added a new php script: unlockevents, which can be used to set back to "pending" status events which are in "syncing" status
. better display of events related to the current node in the admin interface, ContentSync tab (list events for all languages)
