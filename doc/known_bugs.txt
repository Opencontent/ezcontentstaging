1. When an object is deleted, any pending event related to it and not yet synchronized will be left forever in the queue,
   as it will not be able to sync succesfully anymore.
   The only known workaround is currently for the admin to delete those events by hand in the feed page.

   If a cronjob is set up that frequently runs to sync all pending events, the chances for this happening
   are limited.

   There might be other situations arising which will prevent some events from beyng synchronized,
   such as adding a translation to an object then deleting it before the "add translation" event has
   been synchronized.

   A solid solution to this problem is being examined.

2. if a target feed is not a copy of a complete website but only a part of it, and on source server an existing node is moved into the subtree synced to the target,
   not all content data is transferred over (in short: we only support at 100% functionality full site copies for now)

3. See the todo.txt file for more problems, as there are currently MANY known limitations, such as
   - deprecated datatypes are not well supported (see doc.ez.no for a list)
   - webshop datatypes are not well supported (see doc.ez.no for a list)
   - only http basic auth is supported, not oauth
   - target server chaining is untested and most likely not working

4. when using session-based auth, if the caller tries to access an inexisting route, user is logged out - gg, 2012.3.15

5. when using session-based auth, no XSRF protection is active. Se should integrate with ezformtoken - gg, 2012.3.18
